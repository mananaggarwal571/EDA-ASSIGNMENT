Report on EDA for NYC Airbnb Dataset
1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration
The dataset is loaded from a publicly available source on GitHub.
df.info() is used to inspect the dataset structure, including column names, data types, and missing values.
df.isnull().sum() is used to check for missing values in each column.
Purpose: Understanding the datasetâ€™s structure and identifying missing data issues.
2. Handling Missing Values
Numerical columns with missing values are filled using the median (df.fillna(df.median(numeric_only=True), inplace=True)).
Purpose: Ensuring that missing values do not interfere with analysis, using the median to prevent skewing data.
3. Univariate Analysis
Summary statistics (df.describe()): Provides an overview of numerical columns, including count, mean, min, max, and quartiles.
Price distribution (sns.histplot):
A histogram is plotted to visualize the distribution of Airbnb prices.
Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) is used to observe the probability distribution.
Purpose: Understanding price distribution and detecting potential outliers.
Room type distribution (sns.countplot):
A countplot is created to show the distribution of different Airbnb room types.
Purpose: Identifying which room types are most common in NYC.
4. Neighborhood Analysis
A bar chart (train_df.plot.bar()) is created to compare neighborhoods and prices.
Purpose: Identifying price variations across different neighborhoods.
5. Data Visualization
Various visualizations are used to summarize key insights:
Histograms (price distribution).
Count plots (room type frequency).
Bar plots (neighborhood analysis).
Purpose: Making insights more interpretable and highlighting patterns.
Conclusion
This notebook performs an initial exploratory analysis of NYC Airbnb listings, focusing on price distribution, room type popularity, and neighborhood price variations. The data is cleaned by handling missing values, and visualizations are created to better understand pricing trends.
